M-Lab Locate Service, a load balancer providing consistent “expected
measurement quality” using access control.

## Local Development

Typically the locate service will run within a GCP environment, either AppEngine
or GKE. In these cases, the locate service reads signer and verifier keys from
GCP's secret manager. This dependency is not needed for local development.

Create JSON Web Keys for local development:

```sh
jwk-keygen --use=sig --alg=EdDSA --kid=localdev_20220415
```

You may reuse the same key for signer and verifier, or create multiple keys.

```sh
./locate \
    -key-source=local \
    -signer-secret-name ./jwk_sig_EdDSA_localdev_20220415 \
    -verify-secret-name ./jwk_sig_EdDSA_localdev_20220415.pub
```

Now you may visit localhost:8080 in your browser to see a response generating
`access_token`s using these keys. Of course, the URLs returns will not be valid
for the public platform.
