        All requests are scheduled as part of a "shared" resource pool. This
        is a good choice for small client integrations. When the platform is
        overloaded and the locate API must choose which requests to allow and
        which to block, priority is given to requests using explicit API keys
        to the /v2/priority/* resource.

        This resource does not require an API key. All requests to this resource
        are managed collectively as if they all used a single API key.

        This resource requires an API key. When the system is under sufficient
        load that the locate API must choose which requests to allow and which
        to reject, these requests are prioritized over "shared" requests.
